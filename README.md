# Overview

This program provides the user with a working banking app. It allows the user to deposit, withdraw, transfer, and view funds in a checking and savings account. The program uses a main menu that provides the user with ease of use for interacting with the program. With this software, I have attempted to cover a number of contingencies where the user might "break" the program by using values outside of the given paraments within the menu.

This program was created to showcase my learning and understanding of the Rust language basics - utilizing a variety of variables (mutable and immutable), expressions, conditionals, loops, functions. This program is also created to showcase my ability to learn a new language within a short period of time (within 1-2 weeks).
